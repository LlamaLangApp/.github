# LlamaLang App
## Overview
Learning foreign languages and constantly repeating words can be monotonous and tedious. Completely unnecessary! LlamaLang is a mobile application designed to make this process more enjoyable and engaging, through quizzes and mini-games. It incorporates a points-based reward system and competition among users to motivate consistent learning. 

## Installation
1. Clone both frontend and backend repositories on your computer.
  ```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/LlamaLangApp/frontend.git
  $ git clone https://github.com/LlamaLangApp/backend.git
  ```
2. Set-up and run server and app according to instructions: [backend](https://github.com/LlamaLangApp/backend/blob/main/README.md), [frontend](https://github.com/LlamaLangApp/frontend/blob/main/README.md).
 
In the future, we plan to move the application to AWS, the instructions will be updated on an ongoing basis.
